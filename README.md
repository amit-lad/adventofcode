# adventofcode

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges implemented using **R**.

### Overview

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that consists of a series of programming puzzles. Each day, a new challenge is released, and participants are tasked with solving it using their programming skills. This repository showcases my solutions to these challenges, specifically implemented in R.

My objective has been to solve the problems without the use of algorithms in external packages, and for my solutions to have a runtime of <1 minute.

### Repository structure

The repository is structured as follows:

-   **`.Rprofile`** : File containing packages used to solve problems
-   **`20XX/`**: Directory for each year's solutions.
    -   **`20XX_YY.R`**: R script for solving the challenge of Day YY of Year 20XX.

The puzzle data is not stored in this repository.
